## The Rust book's Guessing the number game REBOOTED

#### Play this game

###### Grab an executable file 

All portable, executable files are ready to be downloaded and played instantly in this repository's Release page.

(Linux x64 only :lmao:)

###### or compile this by yourself

This way is suitable for man who has an pretty free weekend.

First, setup Rust toolchain on your PC with help from rust-lang.org

* Windows: Rust + that thicc and heavy VS C++ Build Tools
* Linux: Rust + friendly and lovely gcc/g++ friends which can be runned on just a smol Rasp4.
* Mac: I've ever been touched on a Mac in my life, sorry, but you'll be fine because they guided you already.

Then, clone this repository, `cd` into it then do 

```
cargo build --release
```

for the best performance that verified by lord Stallman (and he looks pretty happily 'bout this, jk).
